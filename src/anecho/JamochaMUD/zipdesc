JamochaMUD, an open-source Java MU* client.

JamochaMUD offers unicode, plug-in, and multi-language support
(currently 8 different languages) to allow a more enjoyable
MUCKing/MUDding experience!  Featuring multi-mucking, 
command history, synchronized window movements, 
experimental Socks5 support, user defined variables and definitions,
and greatly improved ANSI colour support.  Plays nice on *nix 
systems, supports a wider range of MU*'s than before, and also 
includes emulation of some TinyFugue editor controls.
All this while still only using Java 1.1.  See the read.me for 
more information!
