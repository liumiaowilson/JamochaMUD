       Short Description: Source-code for JamochaMUD, an open-source Java MU* client, JMUDLevel, release JMUDVersion
        Long Description: 	JamochaMUD offers unicode, plug-in, and multi-language support
				(currently 8 different languages) to allow a more enjoyable
				MUCKing/MUDding experience!  Featuring multi-mucking, 
				command history, synchronized window movements, 
				experimental Socks5 support, user defined variables and definitions,
				and greatly improved ANSI colour support.  Plays nice on *nix 
				systems, supports a wider range of MU*'s than before, and also 
				includes emulation of some TinyFugue editor controls.
				All this while still only using Java 1.1.  See the read.me for 
				more information!
